.abc escaped

'abc escaped __

"cd escaped"

%tex comment scaped

! A footnote

some
text making one paragraph
-
with a forced line break

|verb| at the start of a par.
A escaped |X||X|, another ||||, and other |_| escapes, like _|X||X|_ these ones.

! Another footnote
	continued here.

another paragraph[foot: continued].

	To relatively indent a paragraph, use the tab.

This executes a command and takes its output as verbatim text:
	[sh
		date ; date
	]

This is the same but uses rc as a shell
	[sh rc
		echo $path
	]

For rc and ql as shells we can just say
	[ql
		echo $argv0
	]

yet another paragraph
	with closely indented par
within other text

this paragraph includes a list of items
	- item 1 starts here and
	continues with more text

	another paragrah within the same item, starting a new itemize
		- 2nd level 1st item
		- 2nd level 2nd item
	- item 2 text
	continued here
	- item 3 text
	using
	multiple lines

after this paragraph comes some indented text with a list
-
of numbered items and another list of items.

	some indented text
	# first numbered item
	# another
	# yet another
	- first item
	- last item

A description list is a list of items where each item ends within the first line and
is followed by indented paragraphs describing the item. It is ok if the entire
description name (item) is marked with a font indicator, but items should be simple
names and cannot have font switches or other markups in the middle.
	- _first description_
		for this and that

		with a second paragraph.

	- |/a/b/c|
		for this other thing
	- -f
		for another thing


this text has some *text set in bold face*
and some in _italic_, and some in |teletype font|.

Within teletype font |no character is special, including _ and *|.
This is good for things like |/a/b/c|.

You can repeat the ** to scape it, or __ or ||.

you can use
+2
(or + any other number) to increase to a bigger font size and
-2
to return to the normal size, and you can use
_
to italize a set of
lines
_
or start an
	indented paragraph and then
	*
	make a set of lines bold
	*
or
|
make a set of lines fixed font
|

this paragraph has indented verbatim text
	[verb with a tag name
		.text starting with dot
		some indented verbatim text, including ['s and ]'s and \n
		nb = 0
		[
			pf = pf.Close()
		]
		wrelems(out, e.Child, lvl+1)
	]
but the verbatim text could be unindented as well.
A tag name (printed in bold) by be given after the |[verb| keyword.

this other paragraph has a cite
[cite: for this] and a url for [url: the lsub page|http://lsub.org] within the rest of the text
you could also place a link to [url: http://google.com].
Imprecise citations like [bib: plan 9 networks, plan b manual, plan b manual] can also be made.
Cites like [cite: intro(1)] refer to the manual.

# NB: You can only use .eps pics (or pic pics).
# if you want any other pic format, just use "convert" from
# imagemagick
#	 convert foo.tiff foo.eps
# or the same for any other format
	[fig key
		logols.eps
	Caption goes here for the figure in eps.
	and perhaps continues here.
	You may use |teletype| and *bold* but all caption is slanted and
	using |_| is a _no-operation_.
	]

Other formats may be used, like png.
	[fig key2
		fig2.png
	Another fig in png.
	]

Or gif:
	[fig key2
		fig3.gif
	Another in gif.
	]

You can write pic directly in place

[pic label
	circle "hola"
	arrow
	circle "caracola"
the caption starts without indentation and
may span several lines. 
]

Fig is number [fig: label].

Use [tbl: key] for tables, [eqn: key] for eqns, and [code: key] for listings.
Do not use these references at the start of text in a line or they may be understood as
an actual table, etc.

for tables and equations we can use
[tbl key
	unused	c	r
	unused	col2	col3
	row1	11	12
	row2	21	22
tables may have captions. The first line of items
always describes column formats, the second line
always describes columns, and the first column always
describes rows. No other table formats are supported.
]

[eqn key
	a sub 3 sup 5
eqns may have captions
]

[code key
	{
		some prog or code
		taken verbatim to be printed
	}
]

[grap
	draw solid
	1896	54.2
	1900	49.4
	1904	49.2

You may reg [fig: label2] other figures.

[pic label2
	circle "hola"

	circle "caracola"
the caption starts without indentation and
may span several lines.
